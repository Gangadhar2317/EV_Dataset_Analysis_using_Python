## 🧠 Key Tasks

1. **Filtering & Grouping**: Filter EVs based on price and range, then calculate average battery capacity per brand.
2. **Outlier Detection**: Use standard deviation to find outliers in energy consumption.
3. **Visualization**: Plot battery capacity vs range using Seaborn.
4. **Recommendation System**: A class-based filter that suggests top EVs based on user input.
5. **Hypothesis Testing**: Perform a t-test comparing Tesla and Audi engine power.
